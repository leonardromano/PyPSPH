# PyPSPH
A python code for solving D-dimensional hydrodynamics with the SPH method
The code is a modified version of my SPH solver (repository 1DSPH) that can make use of the ray library for multiprocessing.

Instructions for installation of ray can be found here here: https://docs.ray.io/en/master/installation.html
